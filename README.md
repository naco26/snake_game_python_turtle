# snake_game_python_turtle


It’s a classic snake game where a snake eats food and continues to grow (in terms of speed and length) and your score gets updated 
(for every food that your snake eats you get 1 point). Eating itself and banging its head on edges/walls are not allowed and will do instant game over.
